# NodeJs + Jest example

This is an example of how to set up a simple NodeJs project with Jest test. Also, it includes an ESLint configuration.

## How to run

First, install all packages.

```
npm install
```

After node_modules has been created, you can simply run:

```
npm test
```

With this, the tests will run and the results will be displayed in your terminal.

## Project structure

The structure is simple.

There are two modules:

- `functions.js`: It perform some basic math operations and handle fake user data.
- `reverseString.js`: It basically exports a function that reverses a string.
